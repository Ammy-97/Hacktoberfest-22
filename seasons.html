    <h3>What are the four seasons and in which month of the year do they occur?
    </h3> 
    <br>
    <ul> 
        Winter – December, January and February. 
        Spring – March, April and May.
        Summer – June, July and August.
        Autumn – September, October and November.
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p>
        Seasons are periods of the year with distinct weather conditions and day lengths. 
        The four seasons — winter, spring, summer, autumn — can vary significantly in characteristics and can prompt changes in the world around them. 
        Here, we explore these four seasons in more detail. 
        Attributes of the seasons may vary by location, but there are still broad definitions that cross most of the boundaries.
